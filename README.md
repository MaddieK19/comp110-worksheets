# Weekly Reflective Reports
#Semester 1:
###Week 1
I hadn't started course on this week.

###Week 2
I started course on Wednesday, had first COMP110 lesson, programming in Python which I know a bit of but need to refresh my memory, I’ll go over the PowerPoints again outside of lessons. 
COMP 120 was on Friday, again programming in Python and using the textbook, I need to read chapters of textbook to catch up and practise with Python.
I need to start doing some research for my essay I'm planning on doing either the Nintendo 64 or the PlayStation. There seems to be more information about the N64 that's easier to find so I'll probably write the essay about that. I've downloaded SpaceChem and tried a few reactors, I'm finding it a bit difficult. I can normally find a solution but not very often the best/fastest solution so I could do with working on my problem solving skills.

###Week 3
COMP 120 was about using strings in Python, most content was new so I should go over it again at home to remember it. COMP 110 was looking at flowcharts and pseudocode. I'm all right with flowcharts but find pseudocode a bit tricky and I need some practise. Whenever I've needed to do pseudocode before I've reverse engineered it from the code after I've wrote it, so I need to start doing it properly before I start programming. 
COMP 130 was looking at the essay and at sources and what ones were good. I need some better sources for my essay.
I've nearly finished the SpaceChem worksheet now just need to do one more level then record and upload it. I've managed to improve some of my earlier solutions but my later ones still need imrpovement. I've done most of the research for the essay and have started writing it now.

###Week 4
COMP110 was using the turtles in Python to draw lines which I want to use in my COMP120 assignment if I can get the hang of it. I've played around with turtles at home as well and tried using arrays instead of making multiple turtles with different names. 
COMP130 was looking at essay writing/structure. I think my essay has next to no structure at the moment and not enough discussion so I need to do a lot of work on it before my tutor appointment on Monday. After that was an intro to classes, I need to look through the piece of code again to make sure I understand the basics of it.
	
I've now submitted the SpaceChem assignment to github and have a tutor session booked for Monday to go over it. The first draft of my essay is nearly done but still needs some improvements.

###Week 5
COMP120 was more altering images, I need to practise proof reading my code. The planning for the pairs programming assignment went well, I now have a basic idea of what I'm making. I'll start working on the COMP110 worksheet for it this week and hopefully get some programming done for it reading week.
I've had a quick look at the Pong tutorial but not attempted it yet and got the Kivy textbook from the library so I can start looking through that.
	
I've got parts of the SpaceChem worksheet signed off but should try and get to the last planets. 
I've got a basic outline of my two flowcharts done, I've tried the pseudocode for one but it needs improving and I need to do the other lot of pseudocode.  I took the first draft of my essay to the tutorial session, I now have a better focus on it so need to find some better sources and to get it ready for Friday

###Week R
I've spent the last two days focusing on my essay. The peer reviews helped a lot so I've changed some bits based on that, I've found more scholarly sources but I'm just struggling to find a way to include them in the essay. The main problem with the essay at the moment is the word count. I'm over 1200 words so need to find a way to cut it down. I also need to organise myself better as well, as my time management is not very good and I need enough time to finish the work for Monday. 
I've been researching different ways to do parts of my tinkering graphics program. I've currently got a loop that fades the image to black but each loop is noticeable and larger images take a long time to process each loop and not very smooth so I want to find another way to do it or maybe use Python with an image library instead of JES. 
My program currently loads the images into an array and can show any of them, I've also got the code written that will make the image fade to black and transition to the next my only issue is linking the separate functions together to make the program work.

###Week 6
I've handed my COMP130 essay in on Monday, my laptop doesn't handle teXworks very well so should look into that. My main problem with the essay was getting it short enough in then end.  I had to cut out some content to keep it within the word count.
I've done a little work on my COMP120 program, but I've mainly been looking at Python image libraries so I can use that instead of JES to get my program running smoother. And I've started making Pong in Kivy and looking into possible references for my COMP110 essay. Also had the guest lecture from Ian Livingstone this week that was really interesting. 

###Week 7
COMP110 was looking at more OOP stuff, I think I understood most of it but need to flick through the PowerPoint again to make sure. I've found a few references for my COMP110 essay but I'm struggling to find 5. Maybe I'm not searching for them the right way. 
I missed Wednesday's lecture because of car troubles, but did the work remotely. I just need to link all of my tinkering graphics files together now and maybe add a colour changing effect. I would like to get it finished in the next 2 weeks so I'm going to work on it for at least half an hour a day.   
I've found all my essay references now but I'm fairly sure two of them aren't relevant enough as they're about robotics not game engines but I couldn't find much else.
Friday was using Trello which seems really useful as my planning for my COMP120 program has been on random scraps of paper until now. I've also started planning my COMP130 Kivy app, my creativity cards were apocalypse and truck and I thinking of using Frogger as my arcade game inspiration.  

###Week 8
COMP120 was using JES to generate and alter sound which was interesting, we've been set the tinkering audio assignment for this module as well so I need to start planning that, I'm going to try and stick to 2 algorithms a week to get the first bit done before the Christmas break, I also need to look into sound libraries for Python.
COMP110 was about reading academic papers which I was struggling with, I have a better idea of how to go around it now. 
I had feedback on my COMP130 essay, I need to work on writing references properly, less typos and structuring my paragraphs better in the next essay.
I don't think there's much left to do in my tinkering graphics project, I need to move the star field effect into the main file and I've had a look at altering colours with Pygame and not sure whether to include that or not. I also need to look into using docstrings in it.

###Week 9
COMP120 was playing around with JES and audio again, I've got my first two algorithms for tinkering audio nearly done now. COMP110 was about using modules, exceptions and Computational complexity. I'm thinking of using modules in tinkering graphics to import the star field effect into the main file.  I need to re-read the PowerPoint on Computational complexities to make sure I understand it. I’ve now got a few docstrings in my tinkering graphics code, but still need a few more.
I've started making some progress on my essay, I've read through all the papers and taken notes on them just trying to structure it in the essay now.  I've been trying to use Kivy, I've been working through tutorials on it but I’m still struggling with it.

###Week 10
I spend most of this week working on my essay and trying to finish it off, the essay review helped but I'm not sure how many improvements I can make without going over the word count. I've moved some text into figures but I'm still close to the word count. 
COMP120 was JES audio again, looking at echoes, envelopes and tone parsing. Echoes didn’t seem too complicated but I am not sure about the tone parser. 

###X1
I started on my COMP130 project, I've added some more cards to my Trello board. I'm using the Pong code as a base for my game and am going to build up from there.   
For COMP110 I've made the database on my server, I'm not sure that I've linked tables correctly though. 

###X2
I've started adding a constellation drawing effect to tinkering graphics, it's adapted from the robot code on the tinkering graphics GitHub repository.  I've changed it so that it will draw a straight line, just need to find a way to make it start drawing on the right angle.   
I've worked on tinkering audio a bit, I've made most of it in JES now so I think I'm going to keep it in JES instead of moving it into regular Python. I just need to finish the tone parser and random audio generation algorithms now.

###X3
I've added a small bit to my constellation code for tinkering graphics.
I’ve done some work on my Kivy app, experimenting with the trucks and how the player controlled object moves. 

###X4
I've got the constellation code working properly with turtle graphics but Pygame has a built in drawing function that looks a lot simpler and will take less code so I'm going to look into that. 
I've changed the orientation of the Kivy app and fixed the window size for now. 

###Week 11
COMP120 was code reviewing, it was good to see other people code it gave me some ideas for my Kivy app. I've been working mostly on the tinkering assignments this week but I've added lives and a timer to my Kivy app and started working on a menu screen.

#Semester 2:
###Week 16
COMP140 was introducing the new modules for this semester and the controller design assignement. I'm interested in using an arduino for my controller but need to look into how difficult it would be. 
COMP110 was support for worksheet 4 which helped me sort out the problem I was having, I was dividing two integers and getting an integer as a result I had to use static cast to convert the numbers into doubles. There was also a guest lecture on Computational Creativity which was really interesting.  
Fridays lecture was on SDL which seems fairly straight forward so far and about the game pitch we need to do next week. My creativity cards were owl, magic and theme park.  

I'm replayed the first planet in SpaceChem and managed to improve most of them and have read the first chapter of Think Like A Programmer and am working through the exercises at the end of the chapter.

###Week 17
COMP140 was on HCI which I think I mostly understood but I'm going to go through the powerpoint again. Also was playing BA games to choose one to base my controller around, I've played a few of them but I'm not sure which one to use yet. I've had a look at some arduino controller code and it doesn't look too complicated but I think it might be better to use the Makey Makey kit and focus on the creative side of the controller.   
The programming practise sessions on Tuesday was about our game designs. It helped me settle on a game design and now I have a pretty good idea of what my game would be like.  
COMP110 was about using github which was good as I had no idea how to use it as a group beyond all of us uploadign out code seperatly and coping and pasting it.  
COMP150...
