# Weekly Reflective Reports

##Week 1
Hadn't started course.

##Week 2
I started course on Wednesday had first COMP110 lesson, programming in Python which I know a bit of but need to refresh my memory. 
Had COMP 120 on Friday, again programming in Python and using the textbook, I need to read chapters of textbook to catch up and play around with Python to get what I've learned to stick in my head.
I need to start doing some research for my essay I'm thinking of doing either the Nintendo 64 or the PlayStation. There seems to be more information about the N64 that's easier to find so I'll probably write the essay about that. I've downloaded SpaceChem and tried a few reactors. I'm finding it a bit difficult but hopefully I'll get my head around it soon.

##Week 3
I had COMP 120 using strings in Python, most content was new so I should practise at home to remember it. COMP 110 was looking at flowcharts and pseudocode. I'm all right with flowcharts but find pseudocode a bit tricky and I need some practise. Whenever I've needed to do pseudocode before I've reverse engineered from the code after I've wrote it, so I need to start doing it properly before I start programming. 
COMP 130 was looking at the essay and at sources and what ones were good I probably need some better sources for my essay.
I've nearly finished the SpaceChem worksheet now just need to do one more level then record and upload it. I've not got any amazing solutions so I might try and redo some to make them better. I've done most of the research for the essay and have started writing it now.

##Week 4
COMP110 was using the turtles in Python to draw lines which I want to use in my COMP120 assignment if I can get the hang of it. I've played around with turtles at home as well and tried using arrays instead of making multiple turtles with different names. 
COMP130 was looking at essay writing/structure. I think my essay has next to no structure at the moment and not enough discussion so I need to do a lot of work on it before my tutor appointment on Monday. After that was an intro to classes, I need to look through the piece of code again to make sure I understand the basics of it.
	
I've now submitted the SpaceChem assignment to github and have a tutor session booked for Monday to go over it. The first draft of my essay is nearly done but still needs some improvements.

##Week 5
COMP120 was more altering images, I need to practise proof reading my code. The planning for the pairs programming assignment went well, I now have a basic idea of what I'm making. I'll start working on the COMP110 worksheet for it this week and hopefully get some programming done for it reading week.
	
I've had a quick look at the Pong tutorial but not attempted it yet and got the Kivy textbook from the library so I can start looking through that.
	
I've got parts of the SpaceChem worksheet signed off but should try and get to the last planets. I've got a basic outline of my two flowcharts done, I've tried the pseudocode for one but it needs improving and I need to do the other lot of pseudocode.  Took the first draft of my essay to the tutorial, I now have a better focus on it so need to find more/better sources and need to get that ready for Friday

##Week R
I've spent the last two days focusing on my essay. The peer reviews helped a lot so changed some bits based on that I've found more scholarly sources I'm just struggling to find a way to include them the essay. The main problem with the essay at the moment is the word count. I'm over 1200 words so need to find a way to cut it down. I also need to organise myself better as well, as my time management isn't very good and I need enough time to finish the work for Monday. 

I've been researching different ways to do parts of my tinkering graphics program. I've currently got a loop that fades the image to black but each loop is noticeable and not very smooth so I want to find another way to do it or maybe use Python with an image library instead of JES. 

My program currently loads the images into an array and can show any of them, I've also got the code written that will make the iamge fade to black and transtion to the next my only issue is linking the the sepeate functiosn together to make the program work.

##Week 6
