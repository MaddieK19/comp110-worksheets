# Weekly Reflective Reports

##Week 1
Hadn't started course.

##Week 2
I started course on Wednesday had first COMP110 lesson, programming in Python which I know a bit of but need to refresh my memory. 
Had COMP 120 on Friday, again programming in Python and using the textbook, I need to read chapters of textbook to catch up and play around with Python to get what I've learned to stick in my head.
I need to start doing some research for my essay I'm thinking of doing either the Nintendo 64 or the PlayStation. There seems to be more information about the N64 that's easier to find so I'll probably write the essay about that. I've downloaded SpaceChem and tried a few reactors. I'm finding it a bit difficult but hopefully I'll get my head around it soon.

##Week 3
I had COMP 120 using strings in Python, most content was new so I should practise at home to remember it. COMP 110 was looking at flowcharts and pseudocode. I'm all right with flowcharts but find pseudocode a bit tricky and I need some practise. Whenever I've needed to do pseudocode before I've reverse engineered from the code after I've wrote it, so I need to start doing it properly before I start programming. 
COMP 130 was looking at the essay and at sources and what ones were good I probably need some better sources for my essay.
I've nearly finished the SpaceChem worksheet now just need to do one more level then record and upload it. I've not got any amazing solutions so I might try and redo some to make them better. I've done most of the research for the essay and have started writing it now.

##Week 4
COMP110 was using the turtles in Python to draw lines which I want to use in my COMP120 assignment if I can get the hang of it. I've played around with turtles at home as well and tried using arrays instead of making multiple turtles with different names. 
COMP130 was looking at essay writing/structure. I think my essay has next to no structure at the moment and not enough discussion so I need to do a lot of work on it before my tutor appointment on Monday. After that was an intro to classes, I need to look through the piece of code again to make sure I understand the basics of it.
	
I've now submitted the SpaceChem assignment to github and have a tutor session booked for Monday to go over it. The first draft of my essay is nearly done but still needs some improvements.

##Week 5
COMP120 was more altering images, I need to practise proof reading my code. The planning for the pairs programming assignment went well, I now have a basic idea of what I'm making. I'll start working on the COMP110 worksheet for it this week and hopefully get some programming done for it reading week.
	
I've had a quick look at the Pong tutorial but not attempted it yet and got the Kivy textbook from the library so I can start looking through that.
	
I've got parts of the SpaceChem worksheet signed off but should try and get to the last planets. I've got a basic outline of my two flowcharts done, I've tried the pseudocode for one but it needs improving and I need to do the other lot of pseudocode.  Took the first draft of my essay to the tutorial, I now have a better focus on it so need to find more/better sources and need to get that ready for Friday

##Week R
I've spent the last two days focusing on my essay. The peer reviews helped a lot so changed some bits based on that I've found more scholarly sources I'm just struggling to find a way to include them the essay. The main problem with the essay at the moment is the word count. I'm over 1200 words so need to find a way to cut it down. I also need to organise myself better as well, as my time management isn't very good and I need enough time to finish the work for Monday. 

I've been researching different ways to do parts of my tinkering graphics program. I've currently got a loop that fades the image to black but each loop is noticeable and larger images take a long time to process each loop and not very smooth so I want to find another way to do it or maybe use Python with an image library instead of JES. 

My program currently loads the images into an array and can show any of them, I've also got the code written that will make the image fade to black and transtion to the next my only issue is linking the the sepeate functiosn together to make the program work.

##Week 6
Handed my COMP130 essay in on Monday, my laptop doesn't handle teXworks very well so should look into that. My main problem with the essay was getting it sort enough in then end.  
I've done a little work on my COMP120 program, but I've mainly been looking at Python image libraries so I can use that instead of JES to get my program running smoother. And I've started making Pong in Kivy and looking into possible references for my COMP110 essay. Also had the guest lecture from Ian Livingstone this week, that was really interesting. 

##Week 7
COMP110 was looking at more OOP stuff, I think I understood most of it but need to flick through the powerpoint again to make sure. I've found a few references for my COMP110 essay but I'm struggling to find 5. Maybe I'm not searching for them the right way. 

I missed Wednesday's lecture becasue of car troubles, but did the work remotely. I just need to link all of my COMP120 program together now and maybe add a colour chaning effect. I would like to get it finished in the next 2 weeks so I going to work on it for atleast half an hour a day. I've found all my essay references now but I'm fairly sure two of them aren't relevant enough as they're about robotics not game engines but I couldn't find much else.

Friday was using Trello which seems really useful as my planning bits for my COMP120 program has been on random scraps of paper until now. I've also started planning my COMP130 Kivy app, my creativeity cards were apocalypse and truck and I thinking or using Frogger as my arcade game inspiration.  

##Week 8
COMP120 was using JES to play around with sound which was interesting, we've been set the tinkering audio assignment for this module as well so I need to start working on that, I'm going to try and stick to 2 algorithms a week to get the first bit done before the christmas break, I also need to look into sound libraries for Python.
COMP110 was about reading academic papers which I was struggling with, I have a better idea of how to go around it now. 
I had feedback on my COMP130 essay, I need to work on writing references properly, less typos and structuring my paragraphcs better in the next essay.
I don't think there's much left to do in my tinkering graphics project, I need to move the star field effect into the main file and I've had a look at altering colours with pygame and not sure whether to include that or not. I also need to look into using docstrings in it.

##Week9
COMP120 was playing around with JES and audio again, I've got my first two algorithms for tinkering audio nearly done now. COMP110 was about using modules, exceptions and Computational complexity. I'm thinking of using modules in tinkering graphics to import the starfield effect into the main file.  I need to re read the powerpoint on Computational complexities to get my head around it a bit better. 
I've started making some progress on my essay, I've read through all the papers and taken notes on them just trying to stick it together in the essay now.  I've been trying to use Kivy, I've been working through tutorials on it but still not really got my head around it. 

##Week 10
I spend most of this week working on my essay and trying to finish it off, the essay review helped but I'm not sure how many improvements I can make without going over the word count. I've moved some text into figures but I'm still close to the word count. 
COMP120 was JES audio again, looking at envelopes and the tone parser algorithms. 

##x1
I started on my COMP130 project, I've added some more cards to my trello board. I'm using the Pong code as a base for my game and am going to build up from there. For Comp110 I've made the database on my server, I'm not 100% sure that I've linked tables correctly though. 

##x2
I've started a constellation effect to tinkering graphics, it's adapted from the robot code on github I've changed it so that it will drawn a straight line on it own, just need to find a good way to make it start drawing on the right angle. I've worked on tinkering audio a bit, I've made most of it in JES now so I think I'm going to keep it in JES instead of moving it into regular python. I just need to finish the tone parser and the envelope algorithms now.

##x3
Added a small bit to my constellation code for tinkering graphics. Did some work on my kivy app, playing around with the trucks and how the player controlled object moves. 

##x4
Got the constellation code working properly with turtle graphics but pygame has a built in drawing function that looks a lot simpler and will take less code so I'm going to look into that. I've changed the orientation of the kivy app and fixed the window size for now. 

##Week 11
COMP120 was code reviweing, it was good to see other people code it gave me some ideas for my kivy app. I've been working mostly on the tinkering assignments this week but I've added lives and a timer to my kivy app and started working on a menu screen.
