#1: Fading to Black
###Flowchart

The flowchart above shows the process I plan to use to make images fade to black. In my program an image will fade to black before transitioning  to the next image. 

###Pseudocode

The pseudocode details the same process as the flowchart, it shows the basic process I will use to make the colour sin the image darken until the image is black.
#2: Image Transition
###Flowchart

This flowchart shows the process I've considered to make one image transition to the next. Two images will be stored as variables, one will be visible, the other won't be displayed but the colours in the pixels in the second image will be set on the pixels on the visible image.
